<h2> Postdoc position </h2>

We are recruiting a postdoctoral researcher to develop mathematical and statistical models of cancer evolution to address important questions regarding optimizing cancer screening and surveillance. These models will combine epidemiological, clinical, and genetic data to understand critical rates driving carcinogenesis that inform us about "windows of opportunity" for effective early detection and interventions. The postdoc should have experience in stochastic modeling and computer simulations, in particular with applications to cancer and/or pre-cancer preferred. They will also build multivariate models that perform risk stratification, test hypotheses, and make predictions using data derived from longitudinal patient records and new (epi)genomic datasets. 

Inter-disciplinary projects include working closely with clinical collaborators, conceptualizing research questions, and joining a dynamic team dedicated to supporting a diverse research program. Funding available for at least 4 years.

Please get in touch with questions. To apply, please email your CV and a statement of research interests to kcurtius@health.ucsd.edu
