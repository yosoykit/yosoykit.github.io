<h2> Postdoc position </h2>

We are recruiting a postdoctoral researcher to develop mathematical and statistical models of cancer evolution to address important questions regarding optimizing cancer screening and surveillance. These models will combine epidemiological, clinical, and genetic data to understand critical rates driving carcinogenesis that inform us about "windows of opportunity" for effective early detection and interventions. The postdoc should have experience in stochastic modeling and computer simulations, in particular with applications to cancer and/or pre-cancer preferred. They will also build multivariate models that perform risk stratification, test hypotheses, and make predictions using data derived from thousands of longitudinal patient records and genomic datasets, including VA healthcare data. 

Inter-disciplinary projects include working closely with clinical collaborators, conceptualizing research questions, and joining a dynamic team dedicated to supporting a diverse research program. Funding available for at least 4 years.

Please get in touch with questions. To apply, please email your CV and a statement of research interests to kcurtius@health.ucsd.edu

<h2> Research Data Analyst position </h2>

We are recruiting a Biostatistician/Data Analyst to perform genetic and clinical epidemiology studies using VA healthcare data. The data analyst should have experience in SQL programming and data analysis utilizing R. They will be responsible for identifying and extracting study-related data into the project workspace, aiding in the application of inclusion/exclusion criteria, and participating closely in operationalizing selection of candidate case and sub-cohort subjects for studies in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. They will manage records for tens of thousands of Veterans within the Million Veteran Program (MVP). The data analyst will be responsible for executing summary data analyses, genome-wide association studies and polygenic risk score derivations, and will contribute to risk prediction modeling with team members. Experience working with VINCI and VHA data is preferable, but this is not critical as the other personnel within our collaborative groups have established expertise working with VHA data and can provide him/her with appropriate training/orientation. 

Inter-disciplinary projects include working closely with clinical collaborators, conceptualizing research questions, and joining a dynamic team dedicated to supporting a diverse research program. Funding available for at least 4 years.

Please get in touch with questions, including how to apply, to kcurtius@health.ucsd.edu.
