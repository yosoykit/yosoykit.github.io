<h2>About me </h2>

In July 2020, I started as an Assistant Professor at UCSD in the Division for Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine. I am also an Associate member of the Cancer Control Program at UCSD Moores Cancer Center. Previous to this, I held a Medical Research Council Rutherford Fellowship at Barts Cancer Institute in London UK, where I began as a postdoc in Prof Trevor Grahamâ€™s Evolution and Cancer lab in 2016. I was a Gastroenterology Research Fellow in the University of Washington Department of Medicine working with Dr. John Inadomi before moving to the UK. I also received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from UW in 2015, working with advisor Dr. Georg Luebeck at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and obtained a BS in Mathematics from UCLA in 2010. 


<h2>Contact</h2>

I am looking to grow this group! Please contact me if you are a PhD student in the UCSD Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program interested in doing a research rotation, or if you are interested in applying to an open postdoctoral position on our team. I am happy to discuss available opportunities and answer questions.
