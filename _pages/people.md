<h2>About Kit</h2>

In July 2020, I started as an Assistant Professor at UCSD in the Division for Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine. I am also an Associate Member of the Cancer Control Program at UCSD Moores Cancer Center. Previous to this, I held a Medical Research Council Rutherford Fellowship at Barts Cancer Institute in London UK, where I began as a postdoc in Prof Trevor Graham’s Evolution and Cancer lab in 2016. I was a Gastroenterology Research Fellow in the University of Washington Department of Medicine working with Dr. John Inadomi before moving to the UK. I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from UW in 2015, working with advisor Dr. Georg Luebeck at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and obtained a BS in Mathematics from UCLA in 2010.

<h3>Caitlin Guccione</h3>
Caitlin is currently a Ph.D. student in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (BISB) program co-advised by Dr. Kit Curtius and Dr. Rob Knight. She graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 2020 with an undergraduate degree in applied mathematics and computer science along with a Masters in applied mathematics. Her current research is focused in the intersection between the human microbiome and cancer. In her free time she enjoys surfing and open water swimming. Email contact: cguccion@ucsd.edu

 <h3>TJ Sears</h3>
TJ is a Ph.D. student in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (BISB) program. He graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in biochemistry & molecular bio, but quickly realized that computational biology is way cooler. He is interested in using various “omics” to measure the various ways in which a tumor can form and resist treatment. When not arguing with his linux terminal, TJ enjoys surfing and playing basketball.

 <h3>David Laub</h3>
David is a PhD student in biomedical informatics with interests in cancer, immunology, and models of their evolution and response to drugs. His current research centers on creating Bayesian models of tumor evolution in melanoma and Barrett’s Esophagus and finding the best ways to see more of TJ’s dog, Snickers. When he’s not “in the lab” he enjoys cooking, playing music, and occasionally catching up on the latest episodes of dating shows.

<h2>Openings</h2>

 Please contact Dr. Curtius by email if you are a PhD student in the UCSD Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program who is interested in doing a research rotation, or if you are (or are soon to be) a doctoral graduate (PhD and/or MD) who is interested in applying to an open postdoctoral position on our team. I am happy to discuss available opportunities and potential projects, and to answer questions.
