Our research focuses on two overall questions:
Q1: How do normal, healthy cells evolve to become cancer cells?
Q2: How do we translate predicted cancer risk to patients' care effectively?

The work focusing on these two questions has traditionally been conducted in isolation from one another. However, molecular and population data available are inextricably linked - the underlying process of cancer evolution manifests in the human body and measurements may be naturally reflected in incidence or in collected patient snapshots based on the timing of clinical recommmendations and interventions in practice.

We leverage these inherent connections by using mechanistic models and bioinformatics methods to integrate both epidemiological and molecular cancer data in order to test and validate hypotheses. With a current focus on gastrointestinal cancers, we seek a coherent understanding of the carcinogenesis process so we may find and identify dangerous precursors in patients and predict outcomes reliably in order to choose appropriate interventions.

The following are some examples of our research questions in GI cancer control:

<h2>"What" are the premalignant alterations that are predictive of future cancers? </h2>

<h2>"When" are patients most at risk to harbor a premalignancy and would benefit from screening? </h2>

<h2>"Who" should we refer for screening and then who requires further interventions? </h2>
