Our research aim is to improve the ability to detect and prevent cancer at the earliest stages. To achieve this, our team develops ways to use quantitative reasoning to better understand the correlations between multi-scale data, ranging from cancer epidemiology to genomic analyses of patient tissues. Data measurements arise from the underlying process of somatic evolution, and mathematical equations can help connect these scales and answer questions surrounding cancer control. Our work requires integration with inter-disciplinary fields (e.g., screening guideline committees, clinicians, geneticists, molecular and computational biologists) that are primed for quantitative translational research for clinical decision-making.
