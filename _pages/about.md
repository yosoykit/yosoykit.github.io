We are an interdisciplinary team based at [UCSD Department of Medicine, Division of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/dbmi/pages/default.aspx) and [UCSD Moores Cancer Center](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/research/moores/Pages/default.aspx). 

Our research aim is to improve the ability to detect and prevent cancer at the earliest stages. 
To achieve this, our team develops ways to use mathematical reasoning to better understand the correlations between multi-scale cancer data arising from the underlying process of somatic evolution. 

Our translational work requires integration with screening guideline committees, clinicians, geneticists, molecular and computational biologists, and other areas that are primed for novel informatics and modeling approaches in cancer control efforts.
