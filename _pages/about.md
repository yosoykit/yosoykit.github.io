Our research aim is to improve the ability to detect and prevent cancer at the earliest stages. To achieve this, our team develops ways to use quantitative reasoning to better understand the correlations between multi-scale data, ranging from cancer epidemiology to genomic analyses of patient tissues, that arise from the underlying process of somatic evolution. Our translational work requires integration with inter-disciplinary fields (e.g., screening guideline committees, clinicians, geneticists, molecular and computational biologists) that are primed for novel quantitative analyses in the area of cancer control.
